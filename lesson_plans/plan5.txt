Certainly! While **derivatives** are formally covered in Calculus, it’s common in **Precalculus** to introduce the *concept* of derivatives as a way to prepare students for Calculus. Here's a sample **lesson plan** titled **“An Introduction to the Idea of Derivatives”**, aimed at building conceptual understanding rather than procedural fluency.

---

### **Lesson Plan: Introduction to Derivatives (Precalculus)**

**Course:** Precalculus
**Lesson Title:** Understanding the Concept of a Derivative
**Duration:** 1 hour 15 minutes
**Instructor:** \[Your Name]
**Week:** 12 (as part of a unit on functions and rates of change)

---

### **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

* Understand the derivative as a rate of change
* Interpret the slope of a curve at a point as the instantaneous rate of change
* Differentiate between average and instantaneous rate of change
* Connect derivatives to real-world motion (e.g., velocity as a derivative of position)

---

### **Materials Needed**

* Graphing calculators or Desmos access
* Whiteboard/markers or digital whiteboard
* Handout with graphs and slope exercises
* Video or animation of a moving object (optional)

---

### **Lesson Outline**

#### **1. Warm-Up: Average Rate of Change (10 minutes)**

* Review the formula for average rate of change:

  $$
  \text{Average Rate} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
  $$
* Quick activity: Students find average rate of change for $f(x) = x^2$ between $x = 1$ and $x = 3$

#### **2. Motivation: Why a New Concept? (5 minutes)**

* Pose a question: "How fast is a car going *right now* if we only know its position over time?"
* Show a position-time graph of a car; discuss why average speed isn’t enough

#### **3. Introduction to Instantaneous Rate of Change (10 minutes)**

* Define instantaneous rate of change conceptually
* Describe how it’s estimated using secant lines approaching a point (tangent line)
* Use visuals or animation to show secant lines converging to a tangent

#### **4. Graphical Exploration (15 minutes)**

* Students use Desmos or graphing calculators:

  * Plot $f(x) = x^2$
  * Draw secant lines between $x = 1$ and nearby points (e.g., 1.5, 1.1, 1.01)
  * Observe slope changes
* Discuss how the slope approaches 2 as $x \to 1$

#### **5. Real-World Connection: Motion (10 minutes)**

* Discuss velocity as the derivative of position
* Use example: A ball thrown in the air (position vs time)

  * What’s the speed at the peak?
  * When is the ball rising/falling fastest?

#### **6. Class Activity (10 minutes)**

* Worksheet: Estimate instantaneous rate of change from a graph (no formulas required)
* Identify where functions are increasing/decreasing most rapidly

#### **7. Wrap-Up and Discussion (10 minutes)**

* Recap: Derivative ≈ slope at a point = instantaneous rate of change
* Ask: “Where do you think this idea leads in Calculus?”
* Encourage curiosity about the formal limit definition (to come in next course)

---

### **Homework Assignment**

* Given a set of functions and tables of values, estimate the instantaneous rate of change at a point
* Optional: Write a paragraph explaining what a derivative is *in your own words*

---

### **Assessment**

* Informal checks for understanding during graphing activity
* Worksheet and homework review
* Next class: Brief quiz reviewing average vs. instantaneous rate of change
