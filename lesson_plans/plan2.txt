### **Lesson Plan: Introduction to Programming with Python**

### **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

* Understand and use basic data types (int, float, str, bool)
* Declare and use variables in Python
* Perform basic input and output operations
* Write simple Python scripts using variables and expressions

### **Lesson Outline**

#### **1. Warm-Up (5 minutes)**

* Quick review: "What is a computer program?"
* Ask: "Has anyone written a program before? What did it do?"

#### **2. Lecture: Variables and Data Types (15 minutes)**

* Explain what variables are and why we use them
* Show examples of variable assignment
* Introduce common data types: integers, floats, strings, booleans
* Use a few print statements to demonstrate

**Sample Code:**

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 20
height = 5.4
is_student = True

print(name, age, height, is_student)
```

#### **3. Lecture: Input and Output (10 minutes)**

* Introduce `input()` function and how to read user input
* Discuss type conversion using `int()` and `float()`

**Sample Code:**

```python
user_age = input("Enter your age: ")
user_age = int(user_age)
print("In 5 years, you will be", user_age + 5)
```

#### **4. Live Coding / Demo (10 minutes)**

* Build a small script with the class:

  * Take userâ€™s name and age
  * Print a greeting and calculate age in 10 years

#### **5. Guided Practice (15 minutes)**

* Students write a script:

  * Ask for name, favorite number
  * Multiply favorite number by 2 and print the result with a message

#### **6. Peer Review / Pair Share (5 minutes)**

* Students trade scripts with a neighbor and run them
* Identify one thing they like and one suggestion

#### **7. Q\&A and Wrap-Up (10 minutes)**

* Answer common questions
* Recap key concepts
* Tease next class topic: conditionals and logic

### **Homework Assignment**

* Write a Python script that:

  * Asks the user for their birth year
  * Calculates and prints their age (assume current year is hardcoded)
  * Outputs whether they are old enough to vote (18+)
